********************************
* Installing and running Adagio:
********************************

   * Linux
   =======
   Extract the files to your folder of choice.
   Use the start script: 
      adagio-start.sh
   Open 
      http://localhost:24444/config.html 
      to create a default configuration.
   Restart Adagio.
   Open
      http://localhost:24444/
      for the main web interface.

   * Windows
   =========
   Launch the installer.
   Launch Adagio (Start Menu).
   Open the Shortcut to the configuration wizard or manually browse to
      http://127.0.0.1:24444/config.html
   Restart Adagio.
   Open the Adagio Monitoring Console (Start Menu) to get the web GUI.

************
* Interface:
************

Point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:24444/

If you have changed the default port for the GUI (24444) you must change the
above URL accordingly.

**************************
* Command line parameters:
**************************

adagio [-f config_file]
agiomon [-f config_file]
agioutils [-f config_file] [-s] [--shutdown]

If -f is not specified, a default adagio.xml will be searched in the 
   current directory. 

The same file must be provided for Adagio, Agiomon and Agioutils because 
   it contains the required information to establish the SOAP/Web link.

Note that agiomon is a java application which needs a Java2 JRE. It's
packaged in a single .jar named agiomon.jar. You can run it from command-line
with

java -jar agiomon.jar [-f config_file]

or

javaw -jar agiomon.jar [-f config_file]

if you are running Windows and don't want the debug console.

***************
* WHAT IS WHAT:
***************

   Adagio   : The core G2 service.
   Agiomon  : A graphical monitoring interface.
   Agioutils: Controller of the service via command-line
      (only option currently is shutdown ;-)

************************
* NOTES FOR LINUX USERS:
************************

There are three scripts provided to launch and stop Adagio, named:

adagio-start.sh
adagio-stop.sh
adagio-kill.sh

For kernel 2.6.x series, you must export the following environment variable:
LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1

Note that the adagio-start.sh will do that for you.

Use the adagio-kill.sh script if something goes wrong using adagio-stop.sh
