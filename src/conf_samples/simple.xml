   <!-- MINIMAL CONFIGURATION FILE -->
   <!-- This file contains only the bare minimum options needed to run Adagio.
         See adagio.xml for all features. The values in that file are the
         default ones, used when absent. -->
   

   <!-- General considerations 

         All time values can be specified with their unit following.
         Allowed units are: d, h, m, s, ms. 
         Omiting the units will be interpreted as seconds. 
         Don't leave spaces between the quantity and their units.

         Sizes use b for bit, B for byte,
         k for 1024 bytes, m for 1024*1024 bytes, g for 1024*1024*1024 bytes.
         k, m and g are case insensitive.

         Speeds are a size plus "/s", which is the only unit allowed.
         A special speed is "unlimited".

         Times, sizes and speeds can contain decimal part (dot is separator).
         Rounding is made towards bytes for sizes/speeds.

         Paths should be specified with forward slashes "/" in 
         windows and unix.
         
         All elements/attributes names are case sensitive!
