   <!-- General considerations 
         All time values can be specified with their unit following.
         Allowed units are: d, h, m, s, ms. 
         Omiting the units will be interpreted as seconds. 
         Don't leave spaces between the quantities and their units.

         Sizes use b for bit, B for byte,
         k for 1024 bytes, m for 1024*1024 bytes, g for 1024*1024*1024 bytes.
         k, m and g are case insensitive.
         Quantities in bits are rounded towards bytes.

         Speeds are a size plus "/s", which is the only unit allowed.
         A special speed is "unlimited".

         Times can contain decimal part (dot is separator).

         Sizes/speeds can't have decimal part.

         Paths should be specified with forward slashes "/" in 
         both windows and unix.
         
         All elements/attributes names are case sensitive!

            Use none if you're stuck in a LAN without direct external access.
         ValidAddresses: public/private/all
            Use public to discard private addresses.
            Use private if you want a LAN network.
            Use all if you are in a mixed environment.
            Note that for local testing you must allow private addresses.
