* Installing Adagio:

In Linux, extract the files to the folder of your choice. 
In Windows, simply launch the executable installer.
Prepare a configuration file (see conf_samples).
Ensure the data folders specified in the configuration file exist (Adalid will
   not create them unless they are direct children of an existing folder).

* Interface:

Point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:25444
If you have changed the default port for the GUI (25444) you must change the
above URL accordingly.

* Command line parameters:

adalid [-f config_file]

If -f is not specified, a default adalid.xml will be searched in the 
   current directory. If not present, default values will apply.
