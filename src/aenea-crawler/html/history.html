         The multipliers/divisors in some of the series are there just to allow
         fitting of them to the common scale.
         </li>
         <li>
         The series "Hub links per leaf" is meaningless before May 2005. Now
         it shows the value as collected from the network, previously it was a
         hardwired value used for estimation purposes.
         </li>
         <li>
         The big growth between January-March 2005 is right for the hub numbers
         but wrong for the network size, which was being estimated with incorrect
         assumptions. In fact I'm considering removing that period altogether from
         the database.
         </li>
         <li>
         Previously to May 2005 the network size was estimated from the hub count.
         After that date the network size is more accurately obtained from unique
         identifiers characterizing each hub and leaf in the network.
