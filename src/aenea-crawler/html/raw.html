Explanation
===========
Current hubs          : Number of alive hubs detected by the crawler.
Current leaves        : Sum of the leaves reported by each hub. Thus every leaf
                        is counted as many times as hubs it's connected to.
Current unique nodes  : Unique nodes detected participating in the network,
                        including both hubs and leaves. This is the most accurate
                        value known for the network size. The size shown in the
                        frontpage is the last 15 minutes average of this value.
Avg leaves per hub    : Current leaves / Current hubs
Avg leaf-to-hub links : Current leaves / (Current unique nodes - Current hubs) =
                        Current leaves / Current unique leaves
                        This is the mean of hubs used by each leaf.
Tracked hosts         : The crawler tracks for some time hubs that have ceased
                        to answer, for the case it is a transitory problem. This
                        number represents the totality of hubs that are tracked.
Last purge (hubs)     : Silent hubs that have been removed from tracking in the
                        last purge operation.
Last purge (unique)   : Removed nodes from the "unique node" list in the last purge.
Pending inbound       : Incoming UDP packets not yet processed.
Pending outbound      : Outgoing UDP packets waiting to be sent.
Planned events        : The crawler uses a event-driven mechanism. This number
                        says how many events are planned for the future. It should
                        match the number of tracked hosts.
Next event deadline   : Seconds until next event will fire.
Last check time       : Seconds since some event/packet arrival/packet departure.
Last event kind       : Last function called.
Longest event duration: Time used in the longest event processing.
Last overtimed task   : A cyclic task whose period has been unduely exceeded.
Memory usage          : Current heap memory used.
Memory usage peak     : Maximum memory usage happened.
Uptime                : Time since crawler launch.
Time to reboot        : The crawler can be scheduled to be rebooted. This value
                        says the remaining time for this to happen.
