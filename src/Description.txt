ADAGIO

Adagio aims to provide a server-only solution for the
Gnutella2 protocol (www.gnutella2.com). It's primary purpose
is to implement all the aspects of this protocol related to serving
capabilities, that principally comprise: Library maintenance, local
querying and hits reporting and upload capabilities to remote clients.

Other related features are bandwidth throttling, multiple queues and,
in general, any complementary aspects that can enhance the server
task.

This project intends to fill the void in currently existing
applications for Gnutella2. The only complete client in existence is
Shareaza (www.shareaza.com) which is only Win32 based. Adagio, in the
contrary, is developed using the freely available Gnat Ada compiler,
which exists for a variety of platforms.

Adagio is designed as a stand-alone application that runs as a service
and that is configured via a simple XML file, in similar fashion to
other server software as is, for example, Apache HTTP server or Resin
servlet container. The lack of a GUI and the multiple platform nature
of Gnat ensures a good cross-platform portability and availability,
which is of special interest for this project, given that it can
enable distributors in any major platform to publish its data in the
Gnutella2 network.

Other technical features of Adagio are derived from the use of Ada:
High reliability is expected for long uptimes, multitasking is fully
profited by mean of the native capabilities in the Ada language, etc.

Adagio is distributed for free under the GPL license.
