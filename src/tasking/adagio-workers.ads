--  Workers: tasks which carry a work that may be aborted by external means.
--  Intended for use with blocking calls.
--  Worker pools allow to have families of related tasks.
--  These tasks wait for a new work to be inserted.

--  We choose to make this package generic so all relevant tasks/protected
--  object can be hidden.
--  Unfortunately, this also means that no multi-purpose tasks can be used.
